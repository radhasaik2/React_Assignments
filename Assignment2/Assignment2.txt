1.What is NPM ?
-->It is used for managing dependencies and any 3rd party libraries for node which simply acts as a package manager.
-->A tool in javascript to build and manage packages required within the code.

2.What is Parcel/Webpack ? why do we need it ?
-->Parcel/Webpack : Both are called as bundlers required to develope applications which contains many other bundlers within them like babel tool,cache making it work faster.
-->It is needed to be used as it handles transpilation,installing of required dependencies,Hot reloading which can understood by browsers.

3.What is .parcel-cache ?
-->When parcel builds a project cache stores the information of that project making it not to re-render when parcel is re-built.
-->It reduces the time taken to build a project also updates any changes been made in project instantly.

4.What is npx ?
-->It is a tool with in npm allows to execute without explicitly installing any packages/tools like parcel.
-->This command executes code/project directly from URl allows to use from remote source.

5.What is difference between dependencies vs dev-dependencies ?
-->Dependencies : Packages in production environment required to run any application in production level.
-->Dev-Dependencies : Packages required to run application only in development level i.e.  in development environment. 

6.what is Tree Shaking ?
-->Tree Shaking : It is also reffered as dead code elimination that means unused modules will not be included in bundle during build process of an application.
-->It reduces the code size in an application.

7.What is Hot Module Replacement ?
-->Hot Module Replacement : It works to update any changes happened in application without reloading the entire page during runtime.
-->It provides faster development and dooesn't change any state of application.

8.List down your favourite 5 superpowers of parcel and describe any 3 of them in your own words ?
-->5 superpowers of parcel :
a)Transpilation , b)Differential Bundling , c)Tree Shaking , d)Hot Reloading , e)Reliable Caching
-->3 superpowers of parcel with description : 
A)Reliable Caching : it contains the complete build process with every information of a project/application making not to build the same code twice.
B)Transpilation :  As the word it self says that it converts a JSX code to React and then to JS to be understood by JS engine and then converts that too into HTML according to browser engine.
C)Hot Reloading : It updates any changes performed automatically making the development faster. 

9.what is .gitignore ? what should we add and not add into it ?
-->.gitignore : File in github repositories used to specify the files that not required to be include or can be ignored prevents from getting committed.

10.What is the difference between package.json and package-lock.json ?
-->package.json : This defines the dependencies with their version required for a project also include name,keyword and other.
-->package-lock.json : This performs locking of versions of the dependencies installed that exactly required.

11.Why should i not modify package-lock.json ?
-->If package-lock.json is modified it changes already present versions of dependencies with inconsistent which causes conflicts when packages are installed.

12.What is node_modules ? is it a good idea to push that on git ?
-->node_modules : when npm install is performed the downloads are copied into this node_module folder and can be imported when required with no specific path.
-->It is not a good idea to push these to git as the dependencies with their version are already stored in package.json and package-lock.json using these dependencies can be installed 
and fetched also it requires a large size.

13.What is the dist folder ?
-->Dist folder : It contains production level code i.e. to store compiled and finished code of application.

14.What is browserlists ?
-->Browserlists : It is used to specify the versions of browser that the application supports to ensure it's compatibility.
